# My Portfolio Website

This is the first iteration of my portfolio website. The sections it currently includes are:

## About

## Skills

## Potfolio

## Contact

You'll notice that there are some sections, components and snippets of code that are commented out. These are a combination of elements from previous iterations that might make a comeback, or snippets that will feature in future iterations as the portfolio progresses.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
